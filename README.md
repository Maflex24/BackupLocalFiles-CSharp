# BackupLocalFiles-CSharp
## Description
Really simple console program to do backup of my files

## Just why?
I code this app, when my hard disc died, and well.. some work was lost :) Not eveything was on github, and sometimes in some project I just forgot to create commit, and push it

## **Some ideas to improve app, if I'll back to coding this:**
- [ ] add path strings to json file, not hardcode this in program.cs
- [ ] create service of copy not only one directory. I have in mind some .json file like:
```
{
  {
    sourcePath = "value",
    destinationPath = "value",
    deletedFilesPath = "value"
  },
  {
    sourcePath = "value",
    destinationPath = "value",
    deletedFilesPath = "value"
  }
}
```
- [ ] maybe add some graphic interface in the future
